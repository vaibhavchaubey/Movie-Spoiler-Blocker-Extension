    title: 'Crazy in every sense',
    description: `Avengers: Endgame is a super cool movie that wraps up the Marvel heroes' big story. It's got lots of funny moments, heartwarming scenes, and crazy action. One of the sad parts is when Iron Man, Tony Stark, has to say goodbye in a heroic way. His sacrifice adds a deep feeling to the story. The time-travel stuff makes things interesting, but the movie still keeps you hooked. The big battle at the end with all the heroes is awesome. Only thing is, it's a pretty long movie, about three hours. Even with that, Avengers: Endgame gives a perfect end to the superhero adventures we've loved.`,
