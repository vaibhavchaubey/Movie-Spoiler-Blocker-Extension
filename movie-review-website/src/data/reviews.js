      'Not as good as Infinity war pacing-wise, but is a satisfying ending to the saga. High production quality, and a great soundtrack like its predecessor. The final fight did feel a little cliché (two armies brainlessly charging at each other for a typical smackdown). Not much to write about, it made every marvel movie before it worth the ticket.',

    title: 'Really Marvel??? Poor Poor Movie To End On!!',
    description:
      "I don't know where to start!! Plot holes all the way through, Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee.",
